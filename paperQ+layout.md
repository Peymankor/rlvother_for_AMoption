## Questions

1. What are similarity and difference of DP and RL? In terms of their mathematical formulation and learning approaches?

2. How does the final policy generated by DP and RL are different? focusing on decision boundary and its graphical representation?

3. Analysing the change in parameters of underlying uncertainty on option Value? (One-way/ Two-way sensitivity analysis)
