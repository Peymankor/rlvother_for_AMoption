# Introduction {#sec-intro}

## LSM model

### The Pricing is based on set of sampling traces of the underlying prices.

### Function approximation of the continuation value for in-the-money states.

The LSM approach uses least squares to approximate the conditional expectaion function at $t_{K-1}, t_{K-2}, \cdots, t_1$:

- Unknown functional form:

$$F(\omega; t_{K-1})$$

- The unknown functional form can be represented as:

$$F(\omega; t_{K-1})=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}a_jL_j(X)$$


In this work choice of basis function is set of Lageurre polynomials:

$$L_1(X)=1$$
$$L_2(X)= 1-X$$    
$$L_3(X) = 1 - 2X + X^2/2$$
$$L_4(X) = 1 - 3X + 3X^2/2 - X^3/6$$ 
$$L_5(X) = 1 - 4X + 3X^2 - 2X^3/3 + X^4/24$$

- In the python code unknown function can be represented as:

$$F(\omega; t_{K-1})=\sum_{j=0}^{5}a_jL_j(X)$$


In this work we focus only in-the-money paths in the estimation since the exercise decision is only relevant when the option is in the money.

### Backward -recursive determination of early exercise states
